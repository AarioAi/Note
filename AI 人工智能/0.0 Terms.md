objectness 物体的对象性:  The confidence score reflects how likely the box contains an object 


fine-tuning

## accuracy, precision, recall, probability, confidence
### accuracy
### precision: object location and class

**Consider a classification model that separates email into two categories: "spam" or "not spam." If you raise the classification threshold, what will happen to precision?**

- [ ] Definitely decrease
- [ ] Definitely increase
- [x] Probably decrease
- [ ] Probably increase

> In general, raising the classification threshold reduces false positives, thus raising precision.

### recall
**Consider a classification model that separates email into two categories: "spam" or "not spam." If you raise the classification threshold, what will happen to recall?**

- [x] Always decrease or stay the same
- [ ] Always increase
- [ ] Always stay constant

> Raising our classification threshold will cause the number of true positives to decrease or stay the same and will cause the number of false negatives to increase or stay the same. Thus, recall will either stay constant or decrease.

### probability

## iteration, epoch, step, batch

* **iteration** or **max batches**: Iterations is the number of batches needed to complete one epoch. The number of batches is equal to number of iterations for one epoch.
* **epoch**: One Epoch is when an ENTIRE dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network only ONCE.
