## Intro

### Bounding Box Prediction

![Bounding Box Prediction](https://github.com/AarioAi/Note/blob/master/_asset/10.9.2.0-bounding-box.jpg?raw=true)

Each boundary box contains 5 elements: (x, y, w, h) and a box confidence score. The confidence score reflects how likely the box contains an object (**objectness**) and how accurate is the boundary box.

The network predicts 4 coordinates for each bounding box, $t_x$, $t_y$, $t_w$, $t_h$. If the cell is offset from the top left corner of the image by ($c_x$, $c_y$) and the bounding box prior has width and height $p_w$, $p_h$.


YOLOv3 predicts an objectness score for each bounding box using **logistic regression**. This should be 1 if the bounding box prior overlaps a ground truth object by more than any other bounding box prior. If the bounding box prior is not the best but does overlap a ground truth object by more than some threshold we ignore the prediction, following. We use the threshold of .5.

### Class Prediction
We do not use a softmax as we have found it is unnecessary for good performance, instead we simply use independent logistic classifiers.

During training we use **binary cross-entropy loss** for the class predictions.

> Using a softmax imposes the assumption that each box has exactly one class which is often not the case.
