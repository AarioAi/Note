# Locks

If transaction T1 holds a shared (S) lock on row r, then requests from some distinct transaction T2 for a lock on row r are handled as follows:
    A request by T2 for an S lock can be granted immediately. As a result, both T1 and T2 hold an S lock on r.
    A request by T2 for an X lock cannot be granted immediately.

If a transaction T1 holds an exclusive (X) lock on row r, a request from some distinct transaction T2 for a lock of either type on r cannot be granted immediately. Instead, transaction T2 has to wait for transaction T1 to release its lock on row r.
```
## (S) Shared Locks: holds the lock to read a row
## (X) Exclusive Locks: holds the lock to update or delete a row
## (I) Intention Locks:  table-level locks
* Intention shared (IS): Transaction T intends to set S locks on individual rows in table t.
* Intention exclusive (IX): Transaction T intends to set X locks on those rows.
```
 SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE sets an IS lock 
 SELECT ... FOR UPDATE sets an IX lock on the table, and then X locks on rows 
        --> SELECT .. WHERE unique_id=xxx FOR UPDATE      is also a record lock
```
### The intention locking protocol is as follows:
* Before a transaction can acquire an S lock on a row in table t, it must first acquire an IS or stronger lock on t.
* Before a transaction can acquire an X lock on a row, it must first acquire an IX lock on t.

Thus, intention locks do not block anything except full table requests (for example, LOCK TABLES ... WRITE). The main purpose of IX and IS locks is to show that someone is locking a row, or going to lock a row in the table.

```
db> SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;
|[
    TABLE LOCK table `test`.`t` trx id 10080 lock mode IX
]|
```


```
db> select * from information_schema.INNODB_LOCKS;     --  show the locks
```
# Record Locks
A record lock is a lock on an index record. For example, `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 = 10 FOR UPDATE;` prevents any other transaction from inserting, updating, or deleting rows where the value of t.c1 is 10.

Record locks always lock index records, even if a table is defined with no indexes. For such cases, InnoDB creates a hidden clustered index and uses this index for record locking. 

# Gap Locks

> 适用于索引，且为非唯一索引。仅会阻塞（阻塞自己及其他session）非唯一索引Gap内的 `insert` 操作，并不会阻塞 `update` 和 `delete`操作。

A lock on the gap before the first or after the last index record.

* `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 BETWEEN 10 and 20 FOR UPDATE;` prevents other transactions from inserting (not from updating or deleting) a value in the range of [10, 20].
* `SELECT * FROM t WHERE b = 10 FOR UPDATE;  -- b is an index, but not a unique index` prevents from inserting a value in a gap range.
```

# Next-Key Locks
A next-key lock is a combination of a record lock on the index record and a gap lock on the gap before the index record.

Lock tables会隐式提交当前事务，unlock tables只有在已经调用lock tables的前提下才会隐式commit；
开启事务(诸如start transaction)会释放当前获取的表锁；
Flush tables with read lock获取的是全局锁，而非表锁；
对于Innodb表，若要使用表锁，必须先设置autocommit=0且innodb_table_locks=1(默认)，否则InnoDB无法侦测表锁而Mysql也无法感知行锁的存在；
且在事务提交后再unlock tables，如下例所示：
调用lock tables时，innodb引擎会获取内部表锁，然后mysql服务器获取表锁；commit时innodb释放内部表锁，unlock tables时mysql服务器才释放表锁；
如果autocommit=1，innodb不会获取内部表锁，极易导致死锁发生；
SET autocommit=0;
LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 READ, ...;... do something with tables t1 and t2 here ...
COMMIT;
UNLOCK TABLES
 
Lock tables与触发器
如果基表上建有触发器，且触发器引用到了其他表，则锁定基表时会连带锁定这些被引用的表
 
LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 READ;
 
CREATE TRIGGER t1_a_ins AFTER INSERT ON t1 FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE t4 SET count = count+1
      WHERE id = NEW.id AND EXISTS (SELECT a FROM t3);
  INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(1, 2);
END;
--t1添加写锁
--t2 添加写锁，即便是申请的读锁，因为在trigger有insert操作，故被转换为写锁
--t3读锁
--t4写锁 


对于MyISAM引擎，DML和lock tables会锁定整个分区表，create view/alter table只会锁住使用的分区，5.6.6引入了partition lock prunning改善了此功能；
而InnoDB，在分区修剪前不会实施行级锁，故不存在锁定整个分区的问题；

## Table Level Lock
* Current read-lock queue (lock->read)
* Pending read-lock queue (lock->read_wait)
* Current write-lock queue (lock->write)
* Pending write-lock queue (lock->write_wait)

### E.g. Read Lock
```
Sess1 db> LOCK TABLES t1 READ;
Sess1 db> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1;   /* it works */
Sess1 db> INSERT INTO t1 SET val="AarioAi"; /* Error: */
|[
ERROR 1099 (HY000): Table 't1' was locked with a READ lock and can't be updated
]|
Sess1 db> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t2;   /* Error: */
|[
ERROR 1100 (HY000): Table 't2' was not locked with LOCK TABLES
]|

Sess2 db> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1; /* OK */
Sess2 db> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t2; /* OK */
Sess2 db> INSERT INTO t1 SET val="AarioAi"; /* pending, nothing insert until t1 unlocked */

Sess1 db> UNLOCK TABLES;  /* queue runs, release blocks */

Sess2 db>       /* block released, write success */
```

### E.g. Write Lock
```
Sess1 db> LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE;
Sess1 db> SELECT * FROM t1; /* works */
Sess1 db> UPDATE t1 SET val="Aario Ai";  /* works */
Sess1 db> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t2; /* Error: */

Sess2 db> SELECT * FROM t1;                     /* pending */
Sess3 db> SELECT * FROM t2;                     /* pending */
Sess4 db> INSERT INTO t1 SET val="Aario";    /* pending */

Sess1 db> UNLOCK TABLES;
